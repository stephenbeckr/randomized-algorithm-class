# Demos

At some point I thought I had a distinction between "vignettes" and "demos" but I think that is gone now. At least I have named them using the same ordering:

- Vignette 1: a simple randomized SVD algorithm assuming exactly low-rank matrix
- Vignette 2: compare deterministic and randomized bubble and quicksorts
- Demo 3: compare different ways to compute the Frobenius norm of a matrix (in C)
- Demo 4: same as demo 3 but for sparse matrices (in Matlab). Comparse row vs column access
- Demo 5: speed/timing results for various Fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transforms
- Demo 6: statistical leverage scores applied to least-squares regressoin
- Vignette 7: random matrix mulitplication via sub-sampling, following Drineas/Mahoney summer school notes
- Demo 8: high accuracy l2 regression via either iterative Hessian sketch or preconditioning (BLENDENPIK/LSRN)
- Demo 9: Randomized Kacmarz for solving consistent over-determined systems of equations
- Demo 10: l1 regression and p-stable distributions (for p=1,2, i.e., Cauchy and Gaussian)
- Demo 11: James-Stein estimator
